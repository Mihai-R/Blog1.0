              <p class="card-text">Apple design chief Jony Ive officially announced his impending departure, after 27 years of working for the Callifornia based company.
                Ive said last week that he is starting LoveFrom, a design company that will provide services to Apple and other companies, initially from California. Meanwhile, Apple’s remaining designers will now report to COO Jeff Williams, who has made multiple appearances at company events discussing health-related initiatives and was said to be heavily involved in the Apple Watch project.</p>

              <p class="card-text">It turns out the Tesla Roadster that is claimed to be “the quickest car in the      world” is not quite as quick as first thought, at least according to company chief Elon Musk.
                The outspoken entrepreneur has sent the internet into meltdown by claiming the Tesla Roadster the takes 2.1 seconds to hit 60mph (96.6km/h).
                If achievable — something that is open for debate given previously difficult-to-match Tesla performance claims — it would still make the Roadster ludicrously fast, out-accelerating every car on the planet to 100km/h.
                However, that 2.1-second claims is 0.2 seconds slower than Tesla’s own marketing on its company website, which states it will top 60mph in 1.9 seconds (the run to 100km/h coincidentally takes 2.1 seconds, too).

              <p class="card-text">Cyberpunk 2077 has had a big few weeks. We finally got a Cyberpunk 2077 release date at E3 2019, and who else delivered the news but Keanu Reeves, who plays the digital ghost of a punk rocker who lives in your character's brain. That was just the start of a flood of news, including a hands-off preview that showed us what life and romance can be like in Night City and a teaser that CD Projekt Red has some big Witcher 3 style expansions planned for Cyberpunk 2077. Multiple endings will keep you busy while you wait for the DLC to arrive.
                <p>Cyberpunk 2077's release is set for April 2020</p>
